Welcome to the git repository of Wieklikt.nl. With Wieklikt.nl we aim to bring people closer together on a more familiar basis. No hassle with meeting strangers through countless sites and applications. Wieklikt.nl offers a platform to become something more than friends with people from your Facebook friendlist.

At Wieklikt.nl we believe that the person you want to spend more time with should not be a stranger but a friend of yours. We are not one of the countless platforms which allows you to meet people. No, we assume that you have already met these people and that one of them is the one you want to be with.

This is exactly what Wieklikt.nl aims to do. We help people taking the next step and probably the hardest step of all; taking that person out on a date.

Wij zijn wieklikt, met wie klik jij?
